# Splunk SIEM Home Lab

## Overview
This is my first cybersecurity project.  
I installed Splunk, collected logs from Windows/Linux, and created detections for failed logins and brute force attempts.  

## Tools
- Splunk
- Windows Security Logs
- Linux syslog

## What I Did
- Set up Splunk in a test environment.  
- Collected logs from Windows and Linux.  
- Wrote queries to detect failed logins.  
- Built a dashboard and created an alert for brute-force attempts.  

## Results
- Detected failed login activity.  
- Built my first SIEM dashboard.  
- Learned how SOC analysts use Splunk.
